# invoicer

### TODOS:
 - [ ] Update Base project - new Authentication
 - [ ] Clean .gitignore from unnecessary files
 - [ ] Check timezone issues, utc time vs local time
 - [ ] Catch errors globally
 - [X] Custom user logging (remove fastapi users)
 - [ ] propagate DB exceptions to the client (in services)
 - [X] Remove fastapi_users_db_sqlalchemy library and keep only fastapi_users (or get rid of it too)


## To continue:
- CRUD EP`s for invoices
